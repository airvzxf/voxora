## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.2] — 2026-09-05

Coordinated patch release for [EPIC #100](https://github.com/airvzxf/voxora/issues/100)
(PR [#105](https://github.com/airvzxf/voxora/pull/105)). All 11 workspace
crates ship at 0.4.2; the previous partial 0.4.1 release (commit
ecbfd2e, docs-only patches on voxora-traits/registry/bridge) remains
on crates.io as a separate tag. Per `AGENTS.md` § "Version coordination".

### Changed
- **MSRV bumped from 1.86 to 1.88.** The declared floor was
  aspirational since `whisper-rs-sys 0.15.0` raised the real floor
  to 1.88 with no CI job defending the claim. Consumers pinned to
  rustc 1.86 or 1.87 will need to update. The new `msrv` CI job
  at `rustc 1.88` enforces the floor going forward.
- **Cargo.toml workspace pin**: `chacha20` bumped from yanked
  0.10.1 to current 0.10.2 (RustCrypto bugfix; public API
  unchanged; 107 transitives unchanged). `deny.toml` now
  enforces `yanked = "deny"` so the next yanked transitive
  surfaces as a hard CI failure in the existing `cargo-deny` job
  instead of a silent warning (issue #96).

### Added
- **CI tracked-artifact guard** (issue #99): the
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml::fmt-check` job now rejects any
  tracked path matching `(target|.cargo-target|.worktrees)/` or
  cargo's content markers (`CACHEDIR.TAG`, `.rustc_info.json`,
  `.rustdoc_fingerprint.json`). Catches the class of bug that
  landed 4289 files into `main` in PR #97.
- **CI single-engine doc matrix** (issue #95): the `doc` job now
  runs `cargo doc --no-deps --workspace` in 4 configurations —
  default features, `--no-default-features`,
  `--no-default-features --features voxora-bridge/whisper`, and
  `--no-default-features --features voxora-bridge/qwen3asr`. The
  matrix uses `fail-fast: false` so a regression in one leg
  still reports the other.
- **CI MSRV check job** (issue #92): a new round-2 job runs
  `cargo check --workspace --locked --all-targets` at
  `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=1.88` to defend the declared `rust-version`.
- **docs.rs metadata** (issue #93): this crate carries a
  `[package.metadata.docs.rs]` block. The hardware-backend
  features (`metal`, `cuda`, `vulkan`) are SDK-gated and stay
  off the docs.rs build via an explicit `features = [...]` list;
  safe features use `all-features = true`.
- **Pre-publish internal-deps guard** in
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` (issue #94): the
  `publish-cratesio` job now reads `cargo metadata` and verifies
  every internal `voxora-*` dependency of the tagged crate is
  already on crates.io at the required semver before publishing.
  Fails fast with an explicit "publish voxora-X first" `::error`
  annotation if not.
- **Badge attributes**: feature-gated public items now carry
  `#[cfg_attr(docsrs, doc(cfg(feature = "...")))]` so docs.rs
  renders the "Available on crate feature X" badge (no-op on
  stable rustdoc; the nightly `doc_cfg` feature gates the
  attribute).

### Fixed
- **`clippy::collapsible_if`** in 9 sites across the workspace.
  Pre-existing on `main` but hidden from CI by stale
  `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` cache.
- **Stale doc references** in `docs/ROADMAP.md` and
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` (the MSRV was still cited as 1.85; an
  example tag referenced the removed `voxora-core` shim).
- **`[workspace.dependencies]` drift** at the root `Cargo.toml`:
  the three crates that landed 0.4.1 at `ecbfd2e` declared
  `version = "0.4.1"` in their own manifests but the workspace
  pins still read 0.4.0. Aligned to 0.4.2 in this release.

### Changed
- `src/engine.rs`: `use voxora_traits::{...}` block unwrapped
  from multi-line to single-line form (now 100 chars on one
  line). This is the documented side effect of the workspace
  adopting `reorder_imports = false` in `rustfmt.toml` (issue #77).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-03

### Changed
- First coordinated-release participation for this crate
  (issue #42). Skipped 0.3.0 because the whisper.cpp adapter
  had no Fase-3 surface change. Now aligned with the rest of
  the workspace at 0.4.0 per the policy in `AGENTS.md` →
  Version coordination. No API change. The `voxora-core`
  shim is removed; this engine adapter consumes the trait
  surface via `voxora-traits` directly.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-03

### Added
- Opt-in `engine-adapter` Cargo feature that adopts
  `voxora_engine::EngineAdapter` so introspectable adapters can be
  composed in `AnyEngine` wrappers (PR A).

### Changed
- Engine crate now carries an opt-in dependency on `voxora-engine`
  via the `engine-adapter` feature. The default feature set is
  unchanged.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-12

Initial published release (`WhisperEngine` over `whisper-rs`,
`metal` / `cuda` / `vulkan` / `cpu` features, `from_hf` behind
the `hf` feature, `#[ignore]`-gated `jfk.wav` parity test).
