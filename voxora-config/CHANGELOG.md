## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] — 2026-09-06

Coordinated minor release for [EPIC #117](https://github.com/airvzxf/voxora/issues/117).
Every workspace crate that participates in this release ships at
0.5.0 per `AGENTS.md` § "Version coordination". No public API
change for `voxora-config` itself; this release adds the
`env_cascade` example (closes #57) and a cross-reference to
`docs/GPU_SUPPORT.md` from the per-crate README (closes #55).

### Added
- **`env_cascade` example** (closes #57): prints the resolved
  cache root, HF token, HF base URL, and default HF revision with
  every cascade layer applied. Pass an optional positional TOML
  path to verify a `voxora.toml` is read at the expected location.
  Run with `cargo run --example env_cascade -p voxora-config`
  (or `... -- voxora.toml`).
- **`docs/GPU_SUPPORT.md` link** from this crate's README
  (closes #55): documents the relationship between the env-var
  cascade (compile-time feature selection lives upstream of the
  runtime probe) and the runtime picker in `voxora-backend`.

## [0.4.3] — 2026-09-06

Coordinated patch release for [EPIC #109](https://github.com/airvzxf/voxora/issues/109)
(PR [#115](https://github.com/airvzxf/voxora/pull/115)). All 11
workspace crates ship at 0.4.3. No public API change, no SemVer
break. Per `AGENTS.md` § "Version coordination".

### Fixed
- **Cargo.toml header drift**: stale "currently 0.4.0"
  comment updated to 0.4.2.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-09-05

Coordinated patch release for [EPIC #100](https://github.com/airvzxf/voxora/issues/100)
(PR [#105](https://github.com/airvzxf/voxora/pull/105)). All 11 workspace
crates ship at 0.4.2; the previous partial 0.4.1 release (commit
ecbfd2e, docs-only patches on voxora-traits/registry/bridge) remains
on crates.io as a separate tag. Per `AGENTS.md` § "Version coordination".

### Changed
- **MSRV bumped from 1.86 to 1.88.** The declared floor was
  aspirational since `whisper-rs-sys 0.15.0` raised the real floor
  to 1.88 with no CI job defending the claim. Consumers pinned to
  rustc 1.86 or 1.87 will need to update. The new `msrv` CI job
  at `rustc 1.88` enforces the floor going forward.
- **Cargo.toml workspace pin**: `chacha20` bumped from yanked
  0.10.1 to current 0.10.2 (RustCrypto bugfix; public API
  unchanged; 107 transitives unchanged). `deny.toml` now
  enforces `yanked = "deny"` so the next yanked transitive
  surfaces as a hard CI failure in the existing `cargo-deny` job
  instead of a silent warning (issue #96).

### Added
- **CI tracked-artifact guard** (issue #99): the
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml::fmt-check` job now rejects any
  tracked path matching `(target|.cargo-target|.worktrees)/` or
  cargo's content markers (`CACHEDIR.TAG`, `.rustc_info.json`,
  `.rustdoc_fingerprint.json`). Catches the class of bug that
  landed 4289 files into `main` in PR #97.
- **CI single-engine doc matrix** (issue #95): the `doc` job now
  runs `cargo doc --no-deps --workspace` in 4 configurations —
  default features, `--no-default-features`,
  `--no-default-features --features voxora-bridge/whisper`, and
  `--no-default-features --features voxora-bridge/qwen3asr`. The
  matrix uses `fail-fast: false` so a regression in one leg
  still reports the other.
- **CI MSRV check job** (issue #92): a new round-2 job runs
  `cargo check --workspace --locked --all-targets` at
  `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=1.88` to defend the declared `rust-version`.
- **docs.rs metadata** (issue #93): this crate carries a
  `[package.metadata.docs.rs]` block. The hardware-backend
  features (`metal`, `cuda`, `vulkan`) are SDK-gated and stay
  off the docs.rs build via an explicit `features = [...]` list;
  safe features use `all-features = true`.
- **Pre-publish internal-deps guard** in
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` (issue #94): the
  `publish-cratesio` job now reads `cargo metadata` and verifies
  every internal `voxora-*` dependency of the tagged crate is
  already on crates.io at the required semver before publishing.
  Fails fast with an explicit "publish voxora-X first" `::error`
  annotation if not.
- **Badge attributes**: feature-gated public items now carry
  `#[cfg_attr(docsrs, doc(cfg(feature = "...")))]` so docs.rs
  renders the "Available on crate feature X" badge (no-op on
  stable rustdoc; the nightly `doc_cfg` feature gates the
  attribute).

### Fixed
- **`clippy::collapsible_if`** in 9 sites across the workspace.
  Pre-existing on `main` but hidden from CI by stale
  `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` cache.
- **Stale doc references** in `docs/ROADMAP.md` and
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` (the MSRV was still cited as 1.85; an
  example tag referenced the removed `voxora-core` shim).
- **`[workspace.dependencies]` drift** at the root `Cargo.toml`:
  the three crates that landed 0.4.1 at `ecbfd2e` declared
  `version = "0.4.1"` in their own manifests but the workspace
  pins still read 0.4.0. Aligned to 0.4.2 in this release.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-03

### Changed
- First coordinated-release participation for this crate
  (issue #42). Skipped 0.3.0 because the env-var cascade had
  no Fase-3 surface change. Now aligned with the rest of the
  workspace at 0.4.0 per the policy in `AGENTS.md` →
  Version coordination. No API change. The `voxora-core`
  shim is removed in this release; this crate never depended
  on it directly.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-03

### Changed
- Bumped to 0.2.0 as part of the Fase 2 coordinated release. No
  functional change; this release aligns the version with the
  breaking changes in `voxora-core` / `voxora-hf` / `voxora-whisper`
  / `voxora-qwen3asr` / `voxora-bridge` / `voxora-cli`.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-09-03

### Added
- New crate. Environment-variable cascade (and optional TOML
  override) that is the single source of truth for the voxora
  workspace. Honours `VOXORA_CACHE_DIR`, `HF_TOKEN`,
  `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN`, `VOXORA_HF_BASE_URL`,
  `VOXORA_HF_REVISION`, plus a layered `voxora.toml` lookup.
- `VoxoraConfig::from_file(path)` resolves the cascade from a TOML
  override file (see `voxora-config/src/file.rs`). The env-var
  cascade itself lives in `voxora_config::env` constants.
- Adapters in `voxora_config::cache` and `voxora_config::hf` so
  downstream crates (`voxora-hf`, `voxora-cli`) can plug in without
  re-implementing the lookup logic.
